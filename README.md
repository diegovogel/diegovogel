## Hi, I'm Diego.

I’m a full-stack engineer and founder of [Birdboar](https://www.birdboar.co/). People like working with me because I listen. I understand their problems with empathy and then provide pragmatic solutions. I want to see everyone around me level up and succeed (unless you’re trying to bring people down, then you should fail).

I live and breathe problem-solving. Whether it’s building a feature that addresses a felt need, making a workflow more efficient, or replacing a leaky faucet, making broken things work again or work better is my fuel. I like my solutions simple but effective. Like flip-flops when you need to cover your feet but only the bottoms.

I geek out about things like automation, web standards, and clever-but-not-hacky solutions. Occasionally, I’ll [write about these things](https://www.diego.works/) and have been featured on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-modal-image-gallery-with-bootstrap-components/) and [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-text-resizing-widget-css-javascript/). But for the most part, I just really like doing the work.

You can also find me on [my personal site](https://www.diego.works/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-vogel/).
